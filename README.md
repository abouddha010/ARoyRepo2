## Suggestions on [BES&T New Electric Supply Connection Site](https://www.bestundertaking.net/NewConnection.aspx)

#### Usability related suggestions :
1. Page scrolls up when we select value from following fields, page should not behave like this :
![Usability_page scroll up when select these fields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78211007/106360003-2aab7780-633c-11eb-88c4-234d1cc343e0.JPG)

2. Photo size is too small, does not allow to upload a normal photo, atleast a Normal photo size (10-50 KB) should be allowed, as most of the registation sites allows it :

3. Preview display is not proper, it is not covering the extra space around the image & image is getting compressed :

4. Grammar mistake, Most of the users don't like & use a web site with grammar mistakes:

5. Text Format is not uniform, check Yes & No text, No is having 0(zero) instead of o :
![Usability_Text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78211007/106389104-af16fc80-6407-11eb-9d65-f9d41ea4d466.JPG)

#### Functionality related suggestions :

1. Form sould be applicable for Firm or company as well, instead of Single person Name , field name should be NAME OF THE APPLICANT/ FIRM

2. Download form option shuould be there as all users don't know how to submit application online, so that they can fill the hard copy & directly submit in the office 

3. Document upload fields should have these options as well to upload necessary documents to avoid fake application:
- Site plan with proposed location of the metering cubicle.
- Latest Tax paid Receipt.
- Route map.
- Authorisation letter.
- If lessee, regd. Lease agreement.

4. Contact Us section should be there incase any user have any question or query, then can contact
example:
***REACH US***
info@xyz.in
(+91) 9510000002 / 814567892 Toll Free

5. We can add These fields to avoid fake applications:
- If the firm is registered in Industries department: Y E S / N O.
- Power supply is required for : COMMERCIAL/ INDUSTRIAL/ WATER SUPPLY/ RESIDENTIAL/ LIFT IRRIGATION/TEMPORARY.
- Premises located in : Private layout/ KIADB area/ KSSIDC/ Municipal/ corporation/ Village panchayat area.
- Is the connection new / addition to existing R. R. No.â€¦


#### UI related suggestions :

1. Field width should be same in a single cell:

2. All the upload related errors should display at a specific place, these should look like laying on the page randomly: 
![2 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78211007/106429606-ac141e80-6490-11eb-9e6e-98834ca9ad55.JPG)

3. If it is mentioned that * marked fields are mandatory then there is no need of displaying text "Required" everytime:

4. These unnecessary tables should get removed, mobile no. , adhar card no. can come in single table:
